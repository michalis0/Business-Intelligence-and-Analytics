# Business Intelligence and Analytics

Dear Students,

Here you will find everything you need for the labs. Simply go to the corresponding week and you will find walkthroughs, exercices, data, and solutions. However, the latter will only be posted after the last lab (Tursdays, shortly after 4pm).

The labs will generally always have the same basic structure:

1. **Walkthroughs:** The TAs will guide you through notebooks that explain how to practically apply concepts seen in the lectures with the help of Python code. These notebooks will greatly help you solve the exercices and the assignment, therefore, it will only benefit you to pay close attention.
2. **Exercices:** You will do these in small breakout rooms with 3 or 4 of your colleagues. We strongly encourage one of you to share his screen and collaborate on it together rather than individually. You will have 10-20mins to do this, according to the length of the exercices.
3. **Solutions:** Upon coming back from the breakout rooms, motivated groups will be able to share their solution (remember, in Python there is an infinite number of solutions to any problem!) with the class. If no group volunteers, the TAs will present a sample solution.
4. **Homework:** No one likes it, but unfortunately it is essential to your success in this class. Most of the homework is given in the first couple of weeks because we have to cover the basics quickly to get to the most interesting parts of the course. Do not feel discouraged by the homework given early in the semester since the amount of it will decrease as the semester moves along.

If you have question or face problems you cannot resolve during the labs, do not hesitate to unmute yourself and ask for clarifications (or use the chat). If you have questions after the labs, please use the appropriate forum on Moodle. Also, remember that Google is your friend, especially while coding!

We are looking forward to a great semester with you,

Your BIA-TAs
