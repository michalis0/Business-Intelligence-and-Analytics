# Pandas - EDA and Scraping

## Goals:

- Review **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Python
- Learn how to plot histograms, heatmaps and find correlations in your data.
- Understand how to get data from web pages using **web-scraping**.

## Lab Structure
1. First, we will cover the [Introduction_to_EDA.ipynb](walkthroughs/Introduction_to_EDA.ipynb) walkthrough. Here, your TA's will show you an introduction into Exploratory Data Analysis.
2. Next, you will learn what scraping is through an example. You do not have to be able to replicate all the code your TA's will show you in this walkthrough, but rather understand what scraping is. A small exercice will follow at the end of the [Introduction_to_scraping.ipynb](walkthroughs/Introduction_to_scraping.ipynb) walkthrough.
3. You will then be able to showcase your skills in the [exercise](Exercises/Exercises/Exercise1_week3.ipynb). You will have 20-25 mins to do it and we will then correct it.


## Exercises at HOME [Optional]
