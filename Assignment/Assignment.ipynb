This is because each crop is typically grown in different regions within a country, depending on factors like soil conditions, irrigation availability, and climatic suitability. For example, wheat might be cultivated in cooler northern regions while corn is grown in warmer southern areas. Therefore, the recorded climate data reflects regional conditions specific to where each crop is grown, rather than national averages. This is an important consideration when interpreting the results of this analysis."
