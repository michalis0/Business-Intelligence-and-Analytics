        "## Part 4: How NOT to select subsets of data\n",
        "This is part 4 of the series \"How to Select Subsets of Data\" from a pandas DataFrame or Series. Pandas offers a wide variety of options for subset selection, which necessitates multiple articles. This series is broken down into the following topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning what not to do\n",
        "In all programming languages, and especially pandas, the number of incorrect or inefficient ways to complete a task heavily outnumbers the efficient or **idiomatic** ones. The term idiomatic refers to code that is efficient, easy to understand, and a common way (among experts) to accomplish a task in a particular library/language. \n",
        "\n",
        "The first three parts of this series showed the idiomatic way of making selections. In this section, we will cover the most common ways users incorrectly make subset selections. Some of these bad habits might be perfectly acceptable in other Python libraries, but will be unacceptable with pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting the right answer with the wrong code\n",
        "One of the issues that prevents users from learning idiomatic pandas, is that it is still possible to get the correct final result while using highly inefficient and non-idiomatic code. Completing a task isn't necessarily indicative that your code is correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few reasons why a solution that gives the correct result might not be good:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A slow solution might not scale to larger data\n",
        "* A solution might work in this particular instance but fail with slightly different data\n",
        "* A solution might be very fast, but hard to interpret by others\n",
        "\n",
        "## Chained indexing with lists\n",
        "**Chained indexing** is the first and most important subset selection problem we will discuss. Chained indexing occurs whenever two subset selections immediately following each other. \n",
        "\n",
        "To help simplify the idea, we will look at chained indexing with Python lists. Let's first create a list of integers:"

        "* A closed bracket followed by an open bracket - Look for **`][`** as with **`df[a][b]`** \n",
        "* **`.loc`** or **`.iloc`** following a closed bracket like in example 3: **`df.iloc[2:5].iloc[:, -3:]`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Another way to determine if you have chained indexing is if you can break the operation up into two lines. For instance, **`df[a][b]`** can be broken up into:\n",

        "* Idiomatic pandas is efficient, easy to read, and common among experts\n",
        "* It is easy to write non-idiomatic pandas - lots of ways to do the same thing\n",
        "* Getting the right answer does not guarantee that you are using pandas correctly\n",
        "* Assignment with chained indexing with a list does not work: **`a[2:6][0] = 5`** - NEVER DO THIS!\n",
        "* Assigning an entire list to a new variable does NOT create a new copy. Both variable names will refer to the same underlying object\n",
        "* Slicing a list creates a shallow copy\n",
        "* To make new copies of any mutable objects within a list, you need to do a deep copy\n",
        "* Chained indexing happens when you make two successive subset selections one directly after the other\n",
        "* Avoid chained indexing in pandas\n",
        "* Identify chained indexing - closed then open brackets **`][`** or **`.loc\\.iloc`** following a bracket like this: **`df[a].loc[b]`**\n",
        "* Another way to identify chained indexing is if you can break up the indexing into 2 lines of code.\n",
        "* Chained indexing is bad because it uses two calls to the indexers instead of one and more importantly triggers the **`SettingWithCopy`** warning when doing an assignment\n",
        "* The **`SettingWithCopy`** warning gets triggered when you make a subset selection and then try to assign new values within this selection. i.e. you have done chained indexing!\n",
        "* Chained indexing is the cause of the **`SettingWithCopy`** warning. Chained indexing can happen in the same line, consecutive lines, or two lines very far apart from each other.\n",
        "* Whenever you make a subset selection, pandas creates either a **view** or a **copy**\n",
        "* A **view** is a reference to the original DataFrame. No new data has been created.\n",
        "* A **copy** means a completely new object with new data that is unlinked from the original DataFrame\n",
        "* The reason the **`SettingWithCopy`** warning exists, is because you might be trying to make an assignment that actually fails or you might be modifying the original DataFrame without knowing it.\n",
        "* Regardless of why the **`SettingWithCopy`** warning was triggered, you should not ignore it. \n",
        "* You need to go back and understand what happened and probably rewrite your pandas so you don't trigger the warning\n",
        "* One of the most common triggers of the **`SettingWithCopy`** warning is when you do boolean selection and then try to set the values of a column like this: **`df[df['col a'] > 5]['col b'] = 10`**\n",
        "* Fix this chained assignment with **`.loc`** or **`.iloc`** like this: **`df.loc[df['col a'] > 5, 'col b'] = 10`**\n",
        "* You can use **`is_copy`** or the private attribute **`_is_view`** to determine if you have a view or a copy\n",
        "* It is not necessary to know whether you have a view or a copy to write good pandas, because you will likely be in one of two scenarios.\n",
        "* In Scenario 1, you will be working on one DataFrame and want to change values in it and continue to use it in its entirety\n",
        "* In Scenario 2, you will make a subset selection, store it to a variable, and want to continue working on it independently from the original data.\n",
        "* To avoid the **`SettingWithCopy`** warning, use **`.loc\\.iloc`** for scenario 1 and the **`copy`** method with scenario 2.\n",
        "* Personally, I avoid using *just the indexing operator* to select rows with slices because it is ambiguous.\n",
        "* I also avoid using **`.at\\.iat`** because it adds unneeded complexity and adds no increased functionality."
