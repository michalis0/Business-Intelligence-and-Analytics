# Colab and Python Notebooks

## What we will cover in the lab

- What are Python notebooks? 
    - They are a complete narrative of code and comments that can render many HTML components, such as images, hyperlinks, videos, etc. Therefore, the goal of a notebook is to demonstrate some code or explain some idea in the most engaging way possible.
- What is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)? (click on the link to review)
    - It is a Python notebook that runs on the cloud so you don't need to install anything on your PC. It runs on the browser.
    - Difference between Code and Text/Markdown: A Python notebook contains two types of cells. Today we will deal with the text/markdown part.
- Shortcuts for entering code and markdown mode in Colab.
    - Convert cell to code cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M Y`
    - Convert cell to text/markdown cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M M`
- Introduction to [markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)
    - Headings, bullets, hyperlinks, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc
    - Tables
    - Latex equations in markdown
    - Review [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for markdown features or the shorter [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Images, videos
    - Go [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week1%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/Notebooks_Introduction.ipynb) and review this notebook to see various features and also how to embed images and videos.
- How to [load](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) in Colab an ipynb from Github
- How to execute some Python code in Colab. How to save your notebook in your Google Drive space.
- Autocomplete in Google Colab for code] [optional]
    - When you write Python code in Colab it helps you "autocomplete" the code. Review this [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb#scrollTo=d4L9TOP9QSHn)

## Lab structure
1. Introduction of TAs
2. Then, we will take a look at this week's [walkthrough](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/labs/01%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/walkthrough/walkthrough_01_markdown_and_exercises.ipynb) to get familiar with the topics of the lab.
3. You will do [exercise 1](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/labs/01%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/exercises/BIA%20Lab%201%20ex1.pdf), where you are asked to recreate a notebook discussing the MSE. 
4. The last challenge of the day will be [exercise 2](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/labs/01%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/exercises/BIA%20Lab%201%20ex2.pdf). Similarly to the first exercise, you will be asked to recreate a notebook on Amazon, a bit more technical, but still totally in your range of capabilities.
5. Finally, you will have a [Quiz](https://moodle.unil.ch/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1871940) at the end of the Lab with two questions, and the answers must be submitted within 48 hours. As a reminder, these quizzes are graded and account for 15% of your final grade.

**AT HOME:** Read the [Notebook Introduction](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/labs/01%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/walkthrough/walkthrough_01_intro_notebooks.ipynb). It revisits what we have covered in the lab and will help you get comfortable with the technology we will be using throughout the semester. (It's short!)

## Exercises

 After you have become familiar with Colab you can do the following exercises in groups of 3 (10-15mins each exercise). One team will be randomly picked to share their solution (if they feel confident it is correct!).

- **Exercise 1:** Recreate [this](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/labs/01%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/exercises/BIA%20Lab%201%20ex1.pdf) in Colab. This may require some knowledge of Latex for recreating the equations, so if you are not very familiar with this just ask your TAs. Here is the link you'll have to embed:

- **Exercise 2:** Recreate [this](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/labs/01%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/exercises/BIA%20Lab%201%20ex2.pdf) in Colab. Here are the links for the images and videos you'll have to embed:
