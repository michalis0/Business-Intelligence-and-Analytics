# Week 9 - Regression 2

This week, we continue to work on Regression with Python.

## Lab Structure
1. As usual, we will go over a [Walkthrough](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week9%20-%20Regression2/Walkthrough/%20Walkthrough_Regression_2.ipynb) in which we'll cover Cross-validation, Overfitting, encoding and higher order linear regression.
3. Then you will complete an [exercise](Exercises/Exercise.ipynb) in breakout rooms.
