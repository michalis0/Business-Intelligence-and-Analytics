Dear students,

Welcome to the Business Intelligence Course assignment! In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to apply the skills you have learned in the course to analyze two datasets. You will use Python and the packages provided in the notebook to analyze a Youtube video dataset, and then use clustering algorithms to classify clients based on their financial data. Once you have completed the tasks in the notebook, you must answer the quiz questions on Moodle and submit the notebook on Moodle. If you have any questions or need help along the way, you can post questions in the dedicated forum on Moodle. We wish you success and good luck!

**Task 1 :** The first one is about a Youtube video dataset. You will have to perform various analysis about this dataset. In contains 5 main question with some sub-questions.

**Task 2 :** The second dataset on is related to credit information of clients. In this second problem, you will first perform some analysis before performing classification using clustering algorithm. To do to so, you sill have to adapt the dataset such as tranforming catgorical variable into numerical variable.

Once you are done with the implmentation of the notebook, you will need to perform the following two steps:
- Answer the quiz questions on Moodle.
- Submit this notebook on Moodle

Make sure to follow all instructions carefully.

Good luck! 🍀

**Note**: Have your notebook with the answers ready for answering the quiz. 

**Questions**: You can post your questions in Moodle in the dedicated forum. No questions will be answered by email.
