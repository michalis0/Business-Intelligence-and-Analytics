A negative skewness indicates that the tail on the left side of the distribution is longer or fatter. A positive skewness indicates that the tail on the right side is longer or fatter. The kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers. A uniform distribution would be the extreme case."
