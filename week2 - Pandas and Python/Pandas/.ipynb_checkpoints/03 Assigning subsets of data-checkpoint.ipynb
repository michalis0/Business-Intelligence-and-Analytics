        "## Assignment\n",
        "When you see the word **assign** used during a discussion on programming, it usually means that a variable is set equal to some value. For most programming languages, this means using the equal sign. For instance, to assign the value 5 to the variable **`x`** in Python, we do the following:\n",

        "```Python\n",
        "x = 5\n",
        "```\n",

        "variable = expression\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "There is quite a bit more to the [Python assignment statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html), but for our purposes it just means using the equal sign to store the object on the right-hand side to the left-hand side.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Documentation on Assigning subsets of data\n",
        "There isn't one particular sub-section of the documentation that covers this topic precisely. Several examples are available throughout the entire [indexing section](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html).\n",

        "## What does this have to do with selecting subsets of data?\n",
        "In this article, we will use the assignment statement, but only after we select a subset of data. We will be doing our subset selection based on what we learned from [part 1](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c) and [part 2](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-39e811c81a0c) and changing just those values.\n",

        "* There is no output when you make an assignment. You must use an extra line to display the DataFrame/Series\n",
        "* Select a specific subset of rows/columns with **`.loc`** or **`.iloc`** and manually assign them value with a list/array.\n",
        "* Use the **`style`** attribute to make particular values pop out for visual display\n",
        "* You can assign entire columns with **`.loc`** or **`.iloc`** by using the colon, **`:`** for rows\n",
        "* A more common operation is to use boolean indexing to select subsets of data before making an assignment\n",
        "* Assigning new values to a Series is similar to DataFrames except that we don't use **`.iloc`** for boolean indexing"
