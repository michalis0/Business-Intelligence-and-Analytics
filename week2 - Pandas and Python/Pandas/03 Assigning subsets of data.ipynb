        "## Part 3: Assigning subsets of data\n",
        "This is part 3 of a 7-part series on how to select subsets of data from a pandas DataFrame or Series. Pandas offers a wide variety of options for subset selection which necessitates multiple articles. This series is broken down into the following 7 topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assignment\n",
        "When you see the word **assign** used during a discussion on programming, it usually means that a variable is set equal to some value. For most programming languages, this means using the equal sign. For instance, to assign the value 5 to the variable **`x`** in Python, we do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "```Python\n",
        "x = 5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This is formally called an [assignment statement][1]. More generally, we can define Python assignment statements as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```Python\n",
        "variable = expression\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "There is quite a bit more to the [Python assignment statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html), but for our purposes it just means using the equal sign to store the object on the right-hand side to the left-hand side.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Documentation on Assigning subsets of data\n",
        "There isn't one particular sub-section of the documentation that covers this topic precisely. Several examples are available throughout the entire [indexing section](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "## What does this have to do with selecting subsets of data?\n",
        "In this article, we will use the assignment statement, but only after we select a subset of data. We will be doing our subset selection based on what we learned from [part 1](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c) and [part 2](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-39e811c81a0c) and changing just those values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The left-hand side will have our subset selection and the right-hand side will contain our new values like this:\n",
        "\n",
