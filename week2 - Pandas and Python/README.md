# Colab and Python Notebooks

Your teaching assistants will show you the following:
- Questions on the previous lab.
- Revisit where all code is saved in github.
- Remind students that when you can open a notebook in Colab, but you should also *save* it in your Google drive, if you want to process it some other day (useful to know for the Bonus assignment you have to make!). If you just open and process an notebook it's not saved by default...
- Revisit how to load in Colab a file from github.
- How to autocomplete Python code.

## Goals:

- Learn how to load different types of dataset
- Load some csv files from the /data in our github. What is the dataset about? What is the numerosity, what is the dimensionality of the dataset? 
- Learn how to convert columns in the appropriate datatype.
- Learn how to do basic operations using the dataframe in Python.

## Lab Structure
1. You will learn how to load csv and JSON files into a Pandas DataFrame, which is covered in the [Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb) walkthrough.
2. You will then be able to showcase your skills in the [exercise](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Pandas/Exercise_1.ipynb). You will have 20-25 mins to do it and we will then correct it.
3. [Optional] For students that wish to refresh Python, we have prepared this [Python_Tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Python_Tutorial.ipynb) walkthrough.

## Exercises at HOME
Please do them all since this is the very base of what we will do all semester. This will be the most you will have to do at home all semester.
