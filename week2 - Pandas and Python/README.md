# Colab and Python Notebooks

Your teaching assistants will show you the following:
- Revisit where all code is saved in github.
- Revisit how to load in Colab a file from github.
- How to autocomplete Python code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#)

## Goals:

- Learn how to load different types of dataset
- Load some csv files from the /data in our github. What is the dataset about? What is the numerosity, what is the dimensionality of the dataset? 
- Learn how to convert columns in the appropriate datatype.
- Learn how to do basic operations using the dataframe in Python.

## Lab Structure
1. We will first refresh your Python knowledge by going over the  [Python_Tutorial.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Python_Tutorial.ipynb) walkthrough.
2. Then you will learn how to load csv and JSON files into a Pandas DataFrame, which is covered in the [Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb) walkthrough.
3. (If time allows it, otherwise do it at home) You will then be able to showcase your skills in the [exercise](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Pandas/Exercise_1.ipynb). You will have 20-25 mins to do it and we will then correct it.

**AT HOME:** (Please do them all since this is the very base of what we will do all semester. This will be the most you will have to do at home all semester.)
