# Association Rules

In this week's lab, we are going to learn about how to perform market basket analysis for finingd frequent itemsets and how to mine for association rules, using the Python library `mlxtend`. You will also become familiar with the notions of support, confidence and lift and see an application of the apriori algorithm.

## Lab Structure

1. Exercise 1: Calculate support, confidence and lift for a set of rules (at beginning of walkthrough)
2. [Walkthrough](Walkthrough/AssociationRules.ipynb): Finding frequent itemsets and mining association rules in Python
3. Exercise 2 using the groceries.csv dataset finding frequent itemsets and interesting association rules (second part of the walkthrough)

## To Do (at home)
* Listen to the pre-recorded lecture on Moodle
* Try to solve on your own the first exercise and calculate support, confidence and lift for the given set of rules
* Go though the walkthrough
* Solve exercise 2
